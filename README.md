# alfred-workflows
A collection of Alfred workflows I've created.

###Generate Guid
Does just what it says on the tin. You can either use a keyword of **"guid"** which will simply copy a new guid to your clipboard or you can hit the hotkey **Cmd+Shift+G** and it will copy it to your clipboard and insert it wherever your cursor currently is.

**Note:** This workflow requires the uuidgen application. I believe it's installed on OS X by default, let me know if that's not the case though.

###Bluetooth Toggle
This one is fairly obvious. You can essentially use a keyword of **"bt"** or **Cmd+Shift+B** and it will toggle your bluetooth radio.

**Note:** This workflow requires the use of the blueutil application, which can be [found here](http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/).
